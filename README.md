# Purpose
Welcome!This repository contains example code on how to create the solution architecture found in this internal 2nd Watch confluence page ->[https://2ndwatch.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BP/pages/2394587314/s3+Hybrid+Access+Solution+Architecture]. 
This is intended to be used as example code only because most organizations will likely already have deployed some of these AWS services if not most.

# High Level Design

## Hybrid connectivity
Interface VPC endpoints are provisioned in a shared services VPC and are accessible from on-premises networks. When interface endpoints are deployed with ENIâ€™s (elastic network interfaces) and are assigned private IP address from the selected subnets within the VPC. To create the connectivity to the private IP addresses a Direct Connect or Site-to-Site will need to be provisioned. The Direct Connect will require a private VIF.

## DNS
A Route53 Private Hosted Zone is created with the regional domain name of the endpoint  (s3.region-name-amazonaws.com) A Route53 Inbound Resolver is needed for on-premises applications to resolve AWS Route53 DNS names. A conditional forwarder rule needs to be configured on the on-premises DNS solution so that DNS queries For AWS names are forwarded to Route53. Lastly, apex and wildcard A records are created in the private hosted zone and traffic is routed to the s3 VPC interface endpoint.

# Prerequisites
* Terraform Version 0.12 and later installation guide ->[https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli]
* AWS CLI Installation guide ->[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html]
* A Site-to-Site VPN or Direct Connect connection is required for this architecture

# Usage
* Update the providers tf file's access key and secret access key values.
    How to create an IAM user ->https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html
* Update the backend configuration in the main tf file
    back end type s3 guide ->https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html
* Update the provider block in the main tf file

* Update the values in the tfvars file appropriately

# Apply new code
Navigate to the file path that the code repository was pulled to in command prompt or terminal (Mac)
Run `terraform init`this will initialize terraform for the given enviromnet
Run `terraform plan --lock=false --var-file=environments/{enviroment}-{region}.tfvars` to validate code changes are expected.
Run `terraform apply --lock=false --var-file=environments/{enviroment}-{region}.tfvars` to execute new code in the enviroment
